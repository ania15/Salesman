# Salesman
This project was a part of an academic course "Computational Intelligence in Data Analysis". It solves the travelling salesman problem using genetic algorithm. It uses roulette and rank selection methods, crossover and mutation to generate the optimal solution. Final result is visualized as the optimal route for the salesman and cost function's values while striving for the best result.
